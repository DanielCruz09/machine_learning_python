This repository chronicles my educational journey in machine learning using the Python programming language. I am currently engaging with the reputable resource, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition" written by Aur√©lien Geron. To enhance accessibility and comprehension, I have thoughtfully structured this repository into distinct chapters mirroring the book's organizational framework. Additionally, I have included the datasets and images generated by the code provided in the aforementioned reference material.
