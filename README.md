This repo documents my learning process for machine learning in Python. I am using Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition by Aur√©lien Geron. I have organized this repo into chapters, which correspond to the chapters from the book. I have also included the datasets and images generated by code provided in the book.
